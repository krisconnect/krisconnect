                    <span>kris:</span> Started working on APIs with python...</br>
                    <span>kris:</span> Learned the basics of API developement.</br>
                    <span>kris:</span> Started cs50 by Harvard...damn it's well made...</br>
                    <span>kris:</span> The lectures (cs50) were simply brilliant. Will do the problem sets before I get back into coding for sure!</br>
                    <span>kris:</span> Finally uploaded my first Assembly bits to Git!</br>
                    <span>kris:</span> Started full stack again yay!</br>
                    <span>kris:</span> Full stack was put aside in favour of machine learning. Got familiar with anaconda and R, did some basic visualisation. Will get back to it after OSCP.</br>
                    <span>kris:</span> Unpredictability is the spice of life...Machine learning and Elasticsearch was on the menu...hopefully by next week this mess clears up...</br>
                    <span>kris:</span> It did! ML and ELK back on the menu boys!</br>
                    <span>kris:</span> Going to jump between ML/ELK/C/APIs for the next couple of months.</br>
                    <span>kris:</span> While waiting to get back into the ELK stack and ML, wrote a webscraper + mailer in python and a simple text summarizer :)</br>
                    <span>kris:</span> Linear algebra basics (CHECK) Wrote a small PageRank algorithm!</br>
                    <span>kris:</span> Started migrating my workspaces in to the cloud, going to start playing with Google Cloud, Azure and AWS.</br>
                    <span>kris:</span> Did some refreshers on W3 and blockchain.</br>
                    <span>kris:</span> Finished ELK stack yay!</br>
                    <span>kris:</span> Finished a bunch of small smart contracts using solidity and radix!</br>
                    <span>kris:</span> Just about halfway done with a DAPP game...go solidity, go js!</br>
                    <span>kris:</span> Now I'm clouded!</br>
                    <span>kris:</span> Finished my habit tracker, a dolled up obsidian and automated some tools for getting back into C! krislib_v0.1 is now in use and ready to be added to!</br>
                    <span>kris:</span> Started my one year hack, dev, math challenge. Gave up on game dev for now and started again with emacs and soon...RUST... </p>br>
                    <span>kris:</span> Almost done with my refresher in C. Than I will dig into Rust! Can't wait!</br>
                    <span>kris:</span> Maybe two more C related exercises than rust. Plus I've started an assembly course! YAY!</br>
                    <span>kris:</span> Assembly, rust and C all the way...</br>
                    <span>kris:</span> Finished all the basics of C... Dev stuff is slowing down for now :)</br>
                    <span>kris:</span> Done with basic math required for ML/AI, done some NNL model projects and prompts, buy me a coffee ;)</br>
